Joins Practice - SQL Task

This repository contains my solution for the SQL Joins Practice Task assigned during my internship. The objective of this task was to understand and implement various types of SQL joins to combine data from multiple tables effectively.

Instructions

Perform the following types of SQL joins on sample tables:

Inner Join: Combines rows where there is a match in both tables.
Left Join: Includes all rows from the left table and matched rows from the right table.
Right Join: Includes all rows from the right table and matched rows from the left table.
Full Join: Combines all rows from both tables, with NULL where there is no match.
